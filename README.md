# OrnsteinUhlenbeck
The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a key model for mean-reverting stochastic behavior, characterized by its tendency to revert to a long-term mean, along with random fluctuations.  I simulated the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, compared calculated parameters with theoretical parameters, analyzed first passage time.  https://youtu.be/dV23py1ISs0
